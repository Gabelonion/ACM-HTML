# Markdown / Git and Github guide

This repository includes a Git and Github guide to create and manage
repositories, also introduces to the basics of a group project using Github,
this content is based on the youtube serie:
[Git & Github tutorial for begginers](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9goXbgTDQ0n_4TBzOO0ocPR)
by The Net Ninja, it is highly recommendable to visit it, since having a visual
reference and following the step by step is useful in different aspects.
It also covers the forking and contributing processes, which is basically
collaborating with open source repositories made by other users in GitHub.

In addition, it has a document, which is better to see the raw version of it,
as the .md source lines are visible only on this visualization, it is the
Markdown text brief guide, which includes the main syntax of .md files, these
files are used to represent or introduce information in our repositories,
specifically in the README.md file, this file is the one that is deployed in
every section, it doesn't matter if it is the main folder or other, it always
deploys, so a good practice is explaining in the best way possible our
projects within the README.md file. For more information of the .md syntax,
visit the [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
GitHub document.
